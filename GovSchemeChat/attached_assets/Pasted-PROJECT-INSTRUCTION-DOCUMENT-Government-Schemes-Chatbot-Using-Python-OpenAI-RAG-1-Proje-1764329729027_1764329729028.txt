Government Schemes Chatbot Using Python + OpenAI + RAG

⭐ 1. Project Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent chatbot that provides accurate information about Central and State Government Schemes. The chatbot will use Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to answer queries such as eligibility, benefits, required documents, and application processes.

⭐ 2. Project Objectives

Provide users with accurate information about government schemes.

Build an AI chatbot using Python and OpenAI API.

Implement RAG to fetch scheme data from uploaded documents.

Create a simple and interactive frontend UI for user interaction.

Demonstrate AI + backend + dataset + UI skills for a capstone project.

⭐ 3. Project Requirements

3.1 Software Requirements

Python 3.9+

VS Code / PyCharm

Pip (Python package manager)

Browser (Chrome/Firefox)

OpenAI API key (free tier works)

3.2 Python Libraries

openai

faiss-cpu

langchain

flask or fastapi

chromadb

sentence-transformers

python-dotenv

3.3 Hardware Requirements

4GB RAM minimum

Stable internet connection

⭐ 4. Project Architecture

User → Frontend → Flask Backend → RAG System → OpenAI → Response

Components:

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

Backend API (Flask or FastAPI)

Document Processor (PDF/Text)

Embedding Model (Sentence Transformers)

Vector Database (FAISS/ChromaDB)

OpenAI for final response generation

⭐ 5. Step-by-Step Instructions

STEP 1 — Set Up Project Folder

Create a folder such as:

govt-schemes-chatbot/

├── data/

├── app/

├── frontend/

├── embeddings/

├── main.py

├── requirements.txt

STEP 2 — Collect Government Scheme Data

Create a dataset containing:

For Each Scheme:

Scheme Name

Benefits

Eligibility Criteria

Required Documents

Application Process

Website Link

Target Group (students, farmers, women, etc.)

Save them as:

PDF files

Text files

CSV files

Place in /data folder.

STEP 3 — Convert Documents into Embeddings

Use Sentence Transformers to convert scheme data into vectors.

Example code:

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

import chromadb

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

Store embeddings in ChromaDB/FAISS.

STEP 4 — Build the RAG Pipeline

RAG steps:

User enters query

Convert query → embedding

Search vector database for relevant schemes

Retrieve top matches

Send retrieved text + query to OpenAI

Generate final answer

STEP 5 — Build Backend (Flask)

Routes:

/ask → receives question

/embed → builds vector DB

/search → fetches matched text

/chat → returns OpenAI answer

STEP 6 — Build the Frontend UI

Create simple files:

index.html

style.css

script.js

UI Contains:

Chat window

Input box

Send button

Response area

STEP 7 — Integrate Frontend + Backend

Use fetch/axios to call Flask API:

fetch("http://localhost:5000/chat", {

method: "POST",

body: JSON.stringify({ question: userText })

})

STEP 8 — Testing the Chatbot

Test with real questions:

“Am I eligible for PMAY?”

“Government schemes for farmers?”

“Documents needed for PM Kisan?”

“Student scholarship schemes?”

Record results in a table.

STEP 9 — Add Additional Features (Optional but High Marks)

Advanced Features:

Voice input/output

WhatsApp/Telegram integration

Scheme recommendation engine

User profile-based suggestions

Admin dashboard to add new schemes

STEP 10 — Final Deployment

Choose deployment:

Render

Railway

AWS

PythonAnywhere

Host:

Backend server

Frontend website

STEP 11 — Write Project Report

Include:

Abstract

Introduction

Problem statement

Existing system vs proposed system

System architecture

Data flow diagram

Screenshots
